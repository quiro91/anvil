/*
 * The key is important. Gradle uses different class loaders for different modules when the plugin
 * is applied through the new plugins { } syntax. If we'd use the same key, then the
 * IncrementalSignal class would be different for the same entry and Gradle would throw an error.
 *
 * By using a random key per class loader we avoid this issue. Since this service isn't shared
 * across modules and only within a module it's not causing any problems tasks only use the service
 * for their project.
 *
 * We could also create one service per module, but that seems wasteful. When the Gradle plugin is
 * added to classpath of the root project, then the key is always the same and all modules share
 * a single build service and a single cache.
